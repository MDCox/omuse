#   Main file for omuse. Right now it doesn't #
# play anything back because the rest of the  #
# program which would allow that simply isn't #
# far enough along to for base functionality. #
# It will currently print out the generated   #
# melody and any song info used to make it.   #
#                                             #
# Later on it will call the other files, and  #
# contain the main loop.                      #
